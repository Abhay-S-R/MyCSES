## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Language & Standards
- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: Standard C++ compiler
- **Libraries**: STL (Standard Template Library)

### Common Patterns Used
```cpp
// Standard template used across solutions
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
#define mod 1000000007

// Fast I/O optimization
ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
cin.tie(0);
cout.tie(0);
```

### Key Algorithmic Techniques
- **Fast Exponentiation**: Binary exponentiation for efficient power calculation
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Using MOD = 1000000007 for large number calculations
- **Dynamic Programming**: Bottom-up and memoization approaches
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity selection and optimization problems
- **Bit Manipulation**: Efficient subset generation and Gray codes
- **Mathematical Formulas**: Combinatorics and number theory

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ks-iitjmu/MyCSES.git
   cd MyCSES
   ```

2. **Compile a solution**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o solution category/problem_name.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the solution**:
   ```bash
   ./solution < input.txt
   ```

## 📊 Problem Solving Approach

Each solution follows a structured approach:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Understanding constraints and edge cases
2. **Algorithm Selection**: Choosing optimal time/space complexity approach
3. **Implementation**: Clean, readable C++ code
4. **Optimization**: Fast I/O and efficient algorithms for competitive programming

## 🏆 Competitive Programming Features
